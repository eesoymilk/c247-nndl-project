\section{Introduction}
Our approach is primarily motivated by the discussions of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and related architectures, 
including long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and gated recurrent units (GRUs), 
which are widely used for sequential data like sEMG signals. 
We further explore a hybrid model that integrates temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) with LSTM and GRU. 
Additionally, we investigate the impact of data quality on model performance by employing various preprocessing techniques 
and evaluating their effects on model accuracy and robustness.
